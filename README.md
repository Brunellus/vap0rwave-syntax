# vap0rwave-syntax theme

This is an 80's vaporwave/outrun theme full of Magenta, cyan, and NEON.


I recommend installing <a href="https://atom.io/packages/editor-background">editor-background</a> by <a href ="https://github.com/camel-chased">camel-chased</a> and using a cool picture in the background!!
